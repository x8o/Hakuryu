Hello, my name is Hakuryu.
I've been working as a data scientist in Tokyo for almost 10 years, mainly building data infrastructure and predictive models for digital advertising and social networking.

The reason why I started my art activities is because I want to express myself more about what exists in my mind. I want to use my past experience in business and my knowledge as a data scientist to express what I want to express.
